<h2>:about me (TL;DR) </h2>
     <p>I am a 17 year old student, pronoun'd he/him (but any call is accepted) who is interested in computer and technology, an amateur enthusiast at something, seems nerdy without glasses, and unindependented.<br>
     <br> I live in UTC+7 timezone (Hanoi), my 12:00 p.m. is your... uh, calc yourself.<br>
     <br> I have a certain enthusiastic in FOSS (free and open-source software), reading book (if it fits my flavour), like playing games, 
     listening to random genre of music/podcast and seldomly watching (Japanese) cartoon or normal movie. I am not a weeb tho, since I am not into Japanese culture or elses. Just enjoying media.
     I am a big fan of monologue (self-talking), this helped me a lot on practicing my language and communication skill. However, I am still shy enough to not actively reach out to some real people, unless they speak Vietnamese (lol)<br>
     <br>I also have a medium to high-level of self-awareness, and I am good at making sudden and weirdsome turns 
     to some people in my Discord friend list if they recently did something that made me feel uncomfortable, 
     which may be in risk of ruining friendships. Not too serious, however, but if you want to be my friend just 
     stay nice and no worries. I appreciate kindness, after all. I am open to requests and ready to be mutuals,
     so if you will to be, don't shy. You can contact with me via my social links on my <a href="/index.html">homepage</a>. 
     <br>
     <br><span style="border-style:initial"><em>I can be strange to y'all here when getting to talk and write in English, such as unsual wording and grammar. I still try to make it better everyday, and probably most of contents written on my website might be older over time and will not totally reflect my current aptitude. So please don't judge me over those lengthy texts--feel free to reach out to me if you really need an inquiry or a fair dinkum check.</em></span><br>
       
     <!--br>about that Discord thing, I may usually leave out your (or a random) server for that "various factors" 
       and sometimes real reason would be unbelievable too.<br!-->
     <br>A little thing that you may (want to) know, I have a sense of humour and I can do some sorta kid/joke everywhere. 
     Just don't make it go worse, I am fine with it. <br>
     <br>I don't know if I am introverted or not, but I can talk with anyone who has the same topic and thought with me, otherwise I only play alone. ADHD? Asperger? No. LGBTQ+ state? Straight. Male. But I support them.<br>
     <br>My fav colours range from <span style="color:#00ffff">#00ffff</span> to <span style="color:blueviolet">#8a2be2</span>, which means aqua and blueviolet. No idea why tho, they just look <em>super</em> pretty. You can notice it throughout my sites' way of decoration. Link colour is brighter tho, for sake of readability.<br>

     Some languages I know (and plan to learn or in progress), including both human and programming language:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Vietnamese: My primary language and mother tongue. I am not so good at analysing literature works, but I am enough at 4 basic communication skills. Some skill at argumentation.</li>
        <br>
        <li>English: My second language. Still learning everyday, and I have no much idea what level am I at. Perhaps between modest and competent. 
          Not good at listening, I usually turn on caption when playing media. I'm striving to learn and speak in proper Australian accent (aka strine or Strayan), because just for somehow I like the culture here.</li>
        <br>
        <li>toki pona: <a href="https://tokipona.org">A simple human language</a> created by Sonja Lang in 2001 (aka a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conlang">constructed language</a> or <em>conlang</em>). I've started learning it since early 2022. 
          But I still get at below than conversationable, due to various factors. Still learning though whenever I can. In fact, toki pona changed my way of thinking and keep my thought somewhat simpler and more open.</li>
        <br>
          <li>HTML/CSS: This came up to my mind when I "was wanting" to create a website. I have slowly learned them since 2021 and now I know a basic amount,
        enough to build a website like this. I can't make a complex website but I can manipulate some CSS tricks from the Internet to achieve a small visual improvement to it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Python: I decided to learn it because it's easy to start. C family seems too much for me. 
          I am currently still not so good at it and can only recall some basic feature like printing string, var def, function binding and that's all. Still learning. Very slow pace tho. Sometimes i even think i have lost interest in it, yet I'm not really sure.</li>
        <br>
          <li>Lua: Stopped learning after a short time in 2022. I think I'd rather learn Python first.</li>
        <br>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto">Esperanto</a>: the <em>lingvo internacia</em> (<em>quốc tế ngữ</em>, or international language as called in my native language). Yet 
          another conlang just like toki pona. No idea why but it's just fun to take a lesson. Not learning in serious, but definitely will take a real look when i have more time. It just feels like a mix of various European languages.</li>
      </ul>
   <br> and maybe some others that I am about to learn in a future time. I have participated in no major project so far, just because I lack basic coding skill. 
    But anyways, I think I can do something to improve it eventually.<br><br>
    <hr>
    My current favourite games (doesn't mean I always play them): Half-Life 2/Episodic, Portal 2, Team Fortress 2, Apex Legends(?), Cave Story, and a lot more. Also Counter-Strike 2 for its updated Source 2 engine. Also Deadlock for Source 2 and its unique gameplay.
     <br>

    <em>Some electronical devices/gadgets that I own or semi own:</em><br>
      <ul>
        <li><mark>Smasnug (yes, you read that right) Galaxy A05</mark>, 6/128/Helio G85 version. Status: <em>front glass broken at about 40% of the screen</em>. I don't feel really satisfying about this one and plan to have a new one. Served ok in most casual tasks since late Oct 2023.</li>
        <br>
        <li><mark>Dell Inspiron 5577</mark> with 8GB of RAM, 128GB+500GB SSD+HDD, Intel Core i5-7300HQ and a Dell OEM GeForce GTX 1050. Currently running Windows 11 (23H2), formerly <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a> (Arch Linux), has a complex history of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/distro-hopping">distro hopping</a>. It used to run Windows 10 around the time I received (Jul 2023). 2/3 USB ports has working data line (the third one got broken after going to a technician's shop near my house to repaste the thermal liquid).</li>
        <br>
        <li>A mouse branded <mark>Metoo Zero</mark> (model uncertain, might be Z12??).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Two USB sticks (an old <mark>2GB Transcend JF V33</mark> and a <mark>32GB Kingston DataTraveller 100 G3</mark>, I took from my dad as he seems not to bother using it).</li>
      </ul>


   <br>This site is manually managed and all the 'blog articles' are written with code inside, by hand. It's not as fast and easy as a blog-dedicated web service, but it's fine for me to do anything on my own. Also 'blog posts' will have no
    comment system, and updating as well as composing time would take a while.</p>
