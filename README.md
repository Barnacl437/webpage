# da webpage
Repo for hosting my personal websites. For more info please read this tldr.

## About stuff 
These webpages are made lightweight despite having many texts inside and (somewhat) fancy CSS looking. It can be healthy for weak connection, old browsers or crap memory amount, as long as it's hosted on concurrent accessible servers, such as no-SSL/HTTPS or HTTP-only connection.

This is my personal webpage in which I will show a bit about me, my personal works, blog, experiments etc. I will use this page as a self-learning gateway to web programming as well as general programming, knowledge sharing, sundry/misc. posting, jokes, stuff, all.

Edit: my blogging activity is moved to a [Substack page](https://barnacl437.substack.com) in the same handle. Read my blogs there for good. (psst: most posts are in vietnamese so if you dont understand a word good luck ig, may write english smth idk)

Edit2: i am thinking of resurrecting the old blog. just stay tuned ig

I created this just to cure/satisfy my willing to create a new own webpage on my hand, using my skill to improve it overtime. I decided to keep everything simple for now.

bleh: i decided to publish my site on [vercel](https://vercel.com) which has faster build time over github pages. Current github.io domain will redirect to my custom domain (proudly powered by [is-a.dev](https://is-a.dev)) automatically, however it will be in risk of being deprecated.

deployment list will not be shown. good luck ransacking it. my codes awa commit history are all open, what would you expect? lol jk nvm

## Usage
If you are not literated in basic HTML coding, you can, yes, copy the code then do anything you want. Find some weird things in there? Nevermind. Otherwise just reading. This is my personal webpage. Or use it as reading a personal blog. idk do wtf u want.

## License
released under [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL). Yes, you may not bother wanting to read all of that long in GNU GPL. I don't criticise GNU, but with my stuff that is/are not going to be serious, I choose WTFPL for minimal further trouble.

## Other trivias and information
This website uses [Intel One Mono](https://github.com/intel/intel-one-mono), an open-source font by Intel intended for developers to use on their IDE editor with ease to read and convenient. Thus I've chosen it to display on my site. ~~However, I can't make this font readable on any devices beyond my personal computer. Gotta work on this later.~~ (I fixed it, and now it works fine. No worries mate.)
Intel One Mono is released under OFL (Open Font License) version 1.1.

kay thatz all have fun.
